# analysis. This only applies if a file is not manually chosen.
selection:
  # What is the order of priority of the file type extensions. This applies
  # in cases where multiple files can be selected (when archives are submitted, for example).
  # Enter without a dot. In cases where the submitted file itself
  # is selected/interesting, it will always have priority (OOXML, Jar files for example).
