  example1:
    # The identifier of the machine that the hypervisor knows. Cuckoo will use it
    # to ask the hypervisor to start this specific machine.

    # The static IP address that has been configured inside of the machine.
    ip: 192.168.122.101
    # The operating system platform installed on the machine.
    platform: windows
    # A string that specifies the version of the operating system installed.
    # Example: "10" for Windows 10, "7" for Windows 7, "18.04" for Ubuntu 18.04.
    os_version: "10"
    # The system architecture. Amd64, ARM, etc. This is used to
    # select the correct stager and monitor builds/component for the machine.

    # The TCP port of the agent running on the machine.

    # (Optional) The MAC address of the network interface of the machine that is used to connect to
    # to the resultserver and the internet.

    # (Optional) a named snapshot that Cuckoo must restore the machine to
    # after each analysis. If this snapshot is not provided, a 'current' snapshot must be set.

    # Machine tags that identify the installed software and other characteristics of the machine.
    # These are used to select the correct machine for a sample that has dependencies. *Notice*: correct tags are
    # crucial in selecting machines that can actually run a submitted sample.
    # Existing automatic tags can be found in the conf/processing/identification.yaml config.
